 Covid19App displays covid19 cases from all around the world.

 This app uses API provided by
 "CORONAVIRUS COVID19 API". You can get the data from here: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc#6fbc46d6-0ddf-400b-a743-a149e9bba381

 Main Page displays global result and a list of countries with covid19 cases.
 User can search country name. Once tapped on the country item, this app takes user to
 another activity where cases are displayed based on province/state.

 If a list of province/state is available, user can search for province/state. In absence of
 province/state, result is displayed based on serial number and search is disabled. Covid19 cases
 are displayed in a pie chart and a bar graph when viewing details.

 The initial data is first loaded into database and displayed in UI.

 Tapping on top 3 items: Recovered, Deaths & Confirmed will sort the list in a descending order
 based on cases.
